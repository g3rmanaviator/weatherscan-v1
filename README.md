# Initial Setup (Source code)

1. Install [node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Acquire *weather.com*, *mapbox.com*, *developer.tomtom*, and *HERE.com* . API keys. These are required for weather data, radar frames, and traffic, respectively.
3. Go to `/main/configs` and open `yourConfig.json`.
4. Line 4 is where your *weather.com*  API key goes. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your *weather.com* API key.
5. Line 5 is where your *mapbox.com*  API key goes. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your *mapbox.com* API key.
6. Line 6 is where your *mapbox.com*  API key goes. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your *developer.tomtom.com* API key. (optional, only if you want traffic report)
7. Line 7 is where your *mapbox.com*  API key goes. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your *HERE.com* API key. (optional, only if you want traffic flow)
8. Save your changes to `yourConfig.json` and close it.
9. In terminal / command prompt within the main directory, run `npm install --production`. This will install all dependencies required to run.
10. In terminal / command prompt within the main directory, run `npm start`. This will start a local web server, which is required to run the sim.
